    "The original source for the shooting victimization data is the Chicago Police Department's \"Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings\" dataset on the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Violence-Reduction-Victims-of-Homicides-and-Non-Fa/gumc-mgzr/about_data). Per the description on the portal:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Each row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim—if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPD classified each incident as a fatal or non-fatal shooting using the following methodology:\n",
    ">A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the dataset does not include officer-involved shootings in its definition of homicide, nor does it include cases of involuntary manslaughter or justifiable homicide:\n",
    ">The definition of “homicide” (shooting or otherwise) does not include justifiable homicide or involuntary manslaughter. This dataset also excludes any cases that CPD considers to be “unfounded” or “noncriminal.” Officer-involved shootings are not included."

Per our methodology, the way to do that is to check whether a ShotSpotter alert occurred within 0.5 miles of the incident and within a one-hour window of the incident's location.
